# Claim Ledger

Every mathematically important statement must be assigned exactly one status.

## Allowed statuses

### KNOWN THEOREM
A published or standard mathematical result. Assumptions and source must be recorded.

### KNOWN CONJECTURE
A recognized unresolved mathematical claim.

### EQUIVALENT CRITERION
A statement rigorously known to be equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis or another identified conjecture.

### HEURISTIC
An analogy, model, probabilistic expectation, or informal explanatory mechanism.

### COMPUTATIONAL OBSERVATION
A finite numerical result produced under explicitly recorded computational conditions.

### PROJECT CONJECTURE
A precise mathematical claim formulated during this project after prior-art investigation.

### PROVED IN PROJECT
A statement accompanied by a complete written proof that has survived adversarial review.

### FAILED CLAIM
A proposed claim invalidated by a counterexample, hidden assumption, circularity, or proof failure.

# Active Claims

## CL-0001

**Status:** KNOWN CONJECTURE

**Statement:** Every nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function has real part 1/2.

**Name:** Riemann Hypothesis

**Project claim?:** No.

---

## CL-0002

**Status:** HEURISTIC

**Statement:** Quantitative comparison of the responses of multiple RH-related diagnostics to controlled symmetric zero perturbations may expose useful differences in their finite-scale detection behavior.

**Project claim?:** No theorem is currently asserted.

**Failure conditions:** The diagnostics may encode equivalent information without a useful quantitative distinction; the proposed response scales may already be known; or synthetic perturbations may fail to preserve enough analytic structure to model a meaningful comparison.

## CL-0003

**Status:** FAILED CLAIM PREVENTION RULE

**Statement:** Verification of finitely many critical-line zeros does not prove the Riemann Hypothesis.

**Purpose:** Prevent finite-to-infinite extrapolation.

---

## CL-0004

**Status:** FAILED CLAIM PREVENTION RULE

**Statement:** Numerical positivity of finitely many Li coefficients does not establish positivity for all Li coefficients.

**Purpose:** Prevent finite computation from being mislabeled as a universal theorem.
